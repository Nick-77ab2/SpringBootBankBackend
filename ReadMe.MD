# What I plan to do with this application

The purpose of this application is to create a backend user-handling and database service for my pseudo-bank. The bank isn't real, but will simulate how one works.
It will work with a React front-end that will take care of user interaction and UI/UX.
This is a re-production of a project I previously did in a class back in college. The main reason for this is to learn React and SpringBoot.
